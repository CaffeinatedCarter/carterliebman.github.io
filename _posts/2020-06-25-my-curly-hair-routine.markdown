Big thing is getting off of shampoo and conditioner with sulfate in it
I transitioned to conditioner-only, where you use conditioner like you use shampoo
It’s a gentler way of cleaning hair that won’t weigh down your curl pattern
This is going to be long but it’s what I’ve sort of developed over the last few months

SHOWER:
- Use conditioner to shampoo at the beginning of your shower 
- Rinse with cold water
- Condition and leave in as you do the rest of your thing
- Rinse with cold water
- Squeeze out water with a t-shirt or other cloth until not dripping
- Run leave-in conditioner through your hair
- Scrunch hair like you see in curly hair videos
- curl setting spray on hands, scrunch into hair
- (optional) diffuse on high, otherwise air dry
NON-SHOWER:
- Above but dampening hair with spray bottle or by running cold water over your hands and scrunching it in hair, then start with leave-in conditioner!
Big thing is not to wash your hair more than two or three times a week
If you shower more frequently just don’t wash it!
(It’s not that long of a routine I swear it just looks intimidating)
The only additional product you’d need is leave-in conditioner and curl setting spray but tbh they’re optional, just really helpful for keeping your hair nice between showers
