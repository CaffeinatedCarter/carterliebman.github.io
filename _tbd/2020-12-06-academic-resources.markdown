*Two quick clarifications:*

*This series of essays comes about now that I’ve committed to a different career path. Whether or not that is because of the difficulties that exist in pursuing technical theatre is not the point. The environment created by many facets of Northwestern’s theatre communities makes it a far more toxic experience than it needs to be, regardless of one’s commitment to pursuing a career in theatre post-grad.*

*Additionally, for brevity’s sake, I’m going to include managers, marketers, and other professional staff in the term “designer.” In the case of these essays, it’s a catch-all term for everyone involved in theatre who is not a performer. This definition is dedicated to every stage manager I’ve had the pleasure of working with: past, present, and future.*
